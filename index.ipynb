    "In the \"Mapping and Table Creation\" lab, we learned how to use Python to map classes to a database table.  We named a database and established a connection to that database, wrote a class that could map to a table in that database, then executed `create_all()` to create the database and that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how if we realized that we made a mistake creating our schema, we were forced to delete the database file and try again?  The problem with `create_all()` is that it only can create tables from scratch.  It cannot modify them afterwards.  SQLAlchemy looks at our models whenever we run `create_all()`.  If the database already has a table matching a class in our models file, SQLAlchemy skips over it until it finds something new to map to the database.  Therefore, we cannot make changes to our models, re-execute `create_all()`, and expect these changes to be reflected in our database.  Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to make changes without having to delete the earlier version of the database and re-create the newer version?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is!  We can use migrations to manage any changes made to our database schema.  Migrations are sort of like a version control for databases.  We can make a table, populate it with data, and, if we decide to add a column later on, we can write a migration to make this change without worrying too much about losing the data in the table.  Migration tools aim to minimize the effect a change in the database schema has on the existing data stored in the tables.  If we later decide to undo this change, we can rollback the migration to return to our database's prior state."
